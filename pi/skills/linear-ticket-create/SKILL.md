# Linear Ticket Create

Read and follow the shared contract in
`workflow/skills/linear-ticket-create.md`.

If the contract is missing in the workspace, try `~/.pi/agent/`, `~/.claude/`, then `~/.agents/` copies of the same relative path. If still missing, stop with `SHARED_CONTRACT_MISSING`.


Rules:
- Use Linear MCP as the Linear integration.
- If no Linear MCP tool is available, stop with `LINEAR_MCP_UNAVAILABLE`
  unless the user explicitly asked for a draft only.
- One ticket equals one behavior equals one PR.

Analyze the mistake or correction that just happened in our conversation.

Then update the CLAUDE.md at the root of this repository:

- Add a concise, actionable rule under "## Common mistakes to avoid"
- Format: "Do NOT [wrong thing] — [correct approach instead]"
- Be specific enough to prevent this exact mistake

Keep total CLAUDE.md under 100 lines.
If adding a rule pushes it over, merge or remove least useful existing rules.

After updating, show the diff of what you changed.
